      content: This is an example test for the evaluation of spatial attributes. On the following pages you will find examples for the evaluation of: <ul><li>Apparent/Auditory Source Width (ASW)</li><li>Listener's Envelopment (LEV)</li><li>Height, width and depth of a stimulus</li><li>Localization of sound sources</li></ul> The test will also give you an overview of the different views that can be used. </br>On the last page will be a short questionnaire to get to know some properties about the participant.</br></br>Push the 'NEXT'-Button to start with this example experiment!

      name: Apparent/Auditory Source Width (ASW) and Listener's Envelopement (LEV)
      content: On this page you have to evaluate the ASW and LEV of the stimulus. You can play back the stimulus by pressing the play button. Afterwards chose the object you want to adjust, to your personal perception of the stimulus, by pressing the according button. Select the Drag and Drop Control Elements (little spheres) and move them to your desired position. When you are finished push the 'NEXT'- Button!

      name: Perceived height, width and depth (HWD) of a stimulus 
      content: Here you have to rate the height, width and depth of two stimuli. So play back one of the stimuli and push the button of the according HWD element. To adjust the height, width and depth move the drag and drop elements! To change the depth and height use the two control points in the middle of the curve, to change the width and form move the 4 control points of the control polygon. You can use the 2D views to adjust the HWD element, the 3D View is just for a better overview.

      name: Localization of a stimulus
      content: Now you have to locate different stimuli. Play back a stimulus and place the spheres, with the colors of the buttons in the according box with the player, to the positions where you perceive sound sources. The number of spheres should fit the number of perceived sound sources and it is not important which sphere represents which sound source. Place the spheres simply by clicking into the scene (here you can also use the 3D view to place the spheres)!
